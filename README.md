This project aims to use information available via Singapore's National Environment Agency's public APIs on data.gov.sg (temperature, humidity, wind) to predict the presence or absence of rain. An SQL database is used to store the data obtained from the APIs. 

For now, only the extracting and cleaning of the data is completed. The machine learning portion of this project is in the works.
